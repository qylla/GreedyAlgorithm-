# Greedy Algorithm & Data Structures – Java Programs

This repository contains two Java console programs related to optimization and logistics:

---

# 🚢 Program 1: Maritime Relief Route Optimization (Greedy Algorithm)

**File:** `MaritimeReliefRouteOptimization.java`

This program applies the **Greedy Algorithm** to determine the shortest route between ports  
in the Relief Route Optimization Problem (RROP).  
The algorithm selects the nearest unvisited location at each step (TSP-style).

### ✅ Sample Output

Greedy TSP Route: A → B → D → C → A
Total Distance: 88 nm


### ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the Java project in NetBeans / IntelliJ / VS Code.
2. Run the main file:

# 📦 Program 2: Min-Heap & Splay Tree Demo

**File:** `HeapSplay_Student.java`

This program demonstrates how **Min-Heap** and **Splay Tree** can be used in logistics, such as:

- Selecting the most urgent delivery (smallest ETA) using Min-Heap  
- Quickly accessing frequently used routes using a Splay Tree

### (Replace with your actual console output)

===== INDIVIDUAL TASK: SHIP LOGISTICS =====
[Min-Heap] Next closest port distance: 15 nm
[Max-Heap] Highest cargo demand: 120 tons
[Splay] Port 205 (B) found? true (splayed to root)


### ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the Java project.
2. Run:
